<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><code>settime [TARGET_IP]</code><br />
</p>

<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<pre class="fragment">If the TARGET_IP value is not given and the environment variable DEST_IP
is set then DEST_IP will be used as TARGET_IP
</pre><h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>This tool creates a master ssh socket named root@<TARGET_IP>_legato_tools in .ssh/ so that it can open subsequent connections quickly. The socket is deleted if the script ends normally.</p>
