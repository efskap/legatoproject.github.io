<div class="textblock"><p>Software update is primarily carried out by the Update Daemon. However, the Supervisor and start also have a role to play in rolling-back when updates fail. start also supports installation (via firmware update or other means) of read-only file systems containing full "golden" systems.</p>
<p>The Update Daemon accepts "update pack" files, which contain software/firmware update instructions and associated data, such as libraries, executables, and resource files.</p>
<p>Update packs can be fed to the Update Daemon via the <a class="el" href="c_update.html">Sofware Update API</a> or through the <a class="el" href="tools_target_update.html">update</a> tool.</p>
<p>The Update Daemon includes hooks that allow update packs to be digitally signed and/or encrypted for security reasons.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="build_toolsmksys.html">mksys</a> tool will automatically generate an update pack file containing the system update.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="tools_host_update-pack.html">update-pack</a> tool can also be used to create update packs containing individual app updates and app removal instructions.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="update_pack.html">Update Pack Format</a> update pack file format is documented <a class="el" href="update_pack.html">here</a>.</p>
