<div class="textblock"><p>Inter-process communication (IPC) allows communication between different processes. A process is one or more threads running inside its own, isolated address space.</p>
<p>Threads running inside the same process communicate easily with each other; they read and write the same data inside their shared address space.</p>
<p>Threads running inside two different processes can't access each other's data; they need IPC to communicate.</p>
<p>Legato's <a class="el" href="c_messaging.html">Low-Level Messaging API</a> and <a class="el" href="interface_def_lang.html">Interface Definition Language</a> provide IPC services without all the coding, packing/unpacking, and security headaches that come with using other methods directly (e.g., network sockets or named pipes).</p>
<p>Legato has built-in IPC features. The language-independent, function-call-oriented IPC approach is automatically handled with the <a class="el" href="build_toolsifgen.html">ifgen</a> tool and the <a class="el" href="build_tools.html">Build</a>.</p>
<p>By default, each app runs in its own sandbox. When an app is constructed, all the IPC services it needs are declared. At runtime, the Supervisor and the Service Directory enforce that only those approved IPC services are accessed by the app.</p>
<p>Using language-independent IPC makes components inherently more reusable, creates opportunities for function isolation in different processes or different app sandboxes, and automatically creates debugging trace points.</p>
<p>Another approach Legato uses for IPC is through low-level messaging APIs: <a class="el" href="c__a_p_is.html">C Runtime Library</a>. This let's you custom build IPC to suit your needs.</p>
