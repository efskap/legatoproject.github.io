<h1><a class="anchor" id="getstartedInstallNotes_yoctoNoPwd"></a>
Log on Without Password</h1>
<p>To log onto the target through the serial interface, log on as <b>root</b> with no password. This allows manual changes to other interfaces (e.g., USB if you want to run CDC-ECM).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="getstartedInstallNotes_yoctoCDC"></a>
CDC-ECM for IP vs Ethernet</h1>
<p>Using CDC-ECM for IP connections will cause the MAC address to change every reboot because the kernel allocates software-defined MAC addresses to interfaces. This may cause new connections to be detected by your host every time you reboot the device. See <a class="el" href="getstarted_config_i_p.html">Configure IP Address</a> and <a class="el" href="tools_target_set_net.html">setNet</a></p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="getstartedInstallNotes_yoctoPrefIP"></a>
Setup Preferred IP</h1>
<p>Either boot with an Ethernet cable plugged in and let the device obtain an IP address using DHCP, or enable CDC-ECM and the micro-USB cable. You can then determine the IP address using <code>ifconfig</code> on the console or provide a fixed IP from your DHCP server. Then use <code>ssh</code> and <code>scp</code> to access the device and transfer files.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="getstartedInstallNotes_yoctoDefUSB"></a>
Change Default USB Classes</h1>
<p>During the boot sequence, startup scripts run the file <code>/etc/legato/usbsetup</code> that enumerates the USB types listed in <code>/etc/legato/usbmode</code>.</p>
<p>You can easily override default types by creating your own <code>usbmode</code> file in <code>/mnt/flash/startup/usb</code>. The new file will take precedence over the old one. By default, the device will enumerate an ECM port, an ACM port for AT commands and USB audio.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="getstartedInstallNotes_yoctoStaticIP"></a>
Setup Target Static IP</h1>
<p>You can configure your target and development PC so it doesn't prompt for a password, run: <b>bin/configtargetssh</b> </p>
<p>It'll look like this: </p><pre class="fragment">dave@devbox:~/legato$ bin/configtargetssh 192.168.1.2

Read/Write rootfs</h1>
<p>It's convenient right now to enable r/w to rootfs, but it will be moving to a read-only model soon. If you change the rootfs (e.g., in /etc, /lib, /bin), you may cripple your device and have to re-install your rootfs.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="getstartedInstallNotes_yoctoNoDown"></a>
Disable New Package Download</h1>
<p>The Yocto build defaults to disable new package downloads.</p>
<p>Enable downloading new packages over the Internet, modify:</p>
<p><code><build-dir>/conf/local</code>.conf value <code>BB_NO_NETWORK</code> to "0" . The file is only present after a build has run once.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="yoctoBSPTestReport"></a>
Setup using BSPTestReport.xls</h1>
<p>The <code>BSPTestReport.xls</code> spreadsheet is used for instructions and reports to help set up different BSP features to test. Start with the Contents sheet.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="getstartedInstallNotes_yoctoNFSRoot"></a>
Use nfs root</h1>
<p>The file <b>meta-swi/meta-swi-mdm9x15/conf/machine/qcom-mdm9615.conf</b> contains examples if you need to include a lot of extra packages in your rootfs or if you build the debug version. See README.bsp for details. Remember to untar the generated rootfs to an exported file system. The file pointed to by the rootfs link contains the most recent root file system. Thereâ€™s more info available at <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/nfs/nfsroot.txt">kernel docs</a>. </p><hr />
