<div class="textblock"><p><code>Component.cdef</code> files can contain these sections:</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="defFilesCdef_assets"></a>
Assets</h1>
<p>Used to describe collections of information (fields) that can be exchanged with cloud services like AirVantage.</p>
<p>The assets section can hold multiple assets, each asset is given a name.</p>
<p>An asset can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>variables</code> values that are readable by the server; writable by the client.</li>
<li><code>settings</code> values that are writable by the server; readable by the client.</li>
<li><code>commands</code> that are custom commands sent from the server and executable by the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>The variable and setting fields can have an associated data type and optionally a default value. The current data types supported are <code> bool, int, float, and string</code>.</p>
<p>In this code sample, <code>helloWorld</code> app has one setting (the message to be logged), one variable (records how many times a message has been logged). The app also exposes two commands: one to log the currently configured message and one to log the default message.</p>
<p>The <code>assets</code> definition looks like this:</p>
<pre class="fragment">assets:
{
    message =
    {
        settings:
        {
            string greeterMessage = "Hello world."   // When requested log this message.
        }

        variables:
        {
            int greetCount     // How many times has a greeting been logged?
        }

        commands:
        {
            greetNow           // Log the message recorded in greeterMessage.
            standardGreeting   // Use "Hello world," instead of what is set in greeterMessage.
        }
    }
}
</pre><p>Once you've defined your assets, it's up to the app to instantiate instances of them at run-time using the <a class="el" href="c_le_avdata.html">AirVantage Data</a> API. Also see <a class="el" href="how_to_a_v_data.html">Manage AirVantage Data</a>.</p>

Bundles</h1>
<p>Lists additional files or directories to be copied from the build host into the app so they’re available to the app at runtime (e.g., audio files, web pages, executable scripts or programs built using some external build system).</p>
<pre class="fragment">bundles:

}
</pre><p>Three things need to be specified for each file or directory:</p><ul>
<li>access permissions</li>
<li>build system path</li>
<li>target path</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Access permissions</b> - any combination of one or more of the following letters, enclosed in square brackets:</p><ul>
<li>r = readable</li>
<li>w = writeable</li>
<li>x = executable</li>
</ul>
<p>If permissions values are not specified, then read-only ([r]) is the default.</p>
<p>Directories always have executable permission set so they can be traversed. Setting the <code>[x]</code> permission in the <code>dir:</code> subsection causes the files under the directory to be made executable.</p>
<p>Setting <code>[w]</code> in the <code>dir:</code> subsection causes all files under that directory to be writeable, but the directory itself will not be writeable.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Directories in the persistent (flash) file system are never made writeable because the on-target flash file system does not support usage quotas (yet).</dd></dl>
<p><b>Build system path</b> - file system path on the build PC where the file is located at build time.</p>
<p>The path can be relative to the directory where the <code></code>.adef file is located.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Environment variables can be used inside these paths.</dd></dl>
<p><b>Target path</b> - file system path on the target where the file will appear at runtime.</p>
<p>It's an absolute path inside the app's sandbox file system.</p>
<p>If the path ends with '/', it means the directory path where the source object (file or directory) will be copied. The destination object will have the same name as the source object.</p>
<p>If the path doesn't end in a '/', it's a full destination object path. The destination object could have a different name than the source object.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>If the app is running unsandboxed, the bundled files and directories can be found in their installation location under <code>/opt/legato/apps/xxxx</code>, where xxxx is replaced by the app name.</dd></dl>
<p><b>Quoting Paths</b></p>
<p>File paths can be enclosed in quotation marks (either single ' or double "). This is required when the file path contains spaces or comment start sequences </p><pre class="fragment">"//" or  "/*"

<p>Contents use the same syntax as the <code>requires:</code> <a class="el" href="def_files_cdef.html#defFilesCdef_requiresApi">API</a> section, except the options are different.</p>
<p>Here's a code sample where <code> greet.api </code> defines a function called <code>Send()</code> where the C source code for the component (in <code>greetServer.c</code>) is implement a function called <code>greet_Send()</code>.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">provides:</div>

<div class="line">    tempControl.c</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>The component must implement the API functions being provided.</p>
<p>In C, the source code must <code>#include “interfaces.h”</code> to get the auto-generated function prototype definitions and type definitions. The function and type names defined in the <code></code>.api files are prefixed with the interface name and an underscore (similar to required APIs).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="defFilesCdef_providesApiManualStart"></a>
[manual-start] Option</h3>
<p>To reduce the initialization code a component writer needs to write, the build tools automatically try to advertise the service when the executable is run. Sometimes this is not the preferred behaviour.</p>
<p>The <b><code></code>[manual-start</b>] option tells the build tools <b>not</b> to automatically advertise this API with the Service Directory when the process starts. If <code></code>[manual-start] option is used, the component can control when it wants to start offering the service to others by calling the <code>xxxx_AdvertiseService()</code> function explicitly in the component source code when it's ready.</p>

<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><h3><a class="anchor" id="defFilesCdef_providesApiAsync"></a>
[async] Option</h3>
<p>The server of a service can also implement the functions as if they were called directly by the client (even though the client may be running inside another process). When the client calls an API function, the server's API function gets called, and when the server returns from the function, the function returns in the client process.</p>
<p>Sometimes the server needs to hold onto the client request and do other things (like handing requests from other clients in the meantime) before sending a response back. This is called asynchronous mode, and is enabled using the <code> [async] </code> keyword on the end of the <code>api</code> section entry:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">provides:</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    api:</div>
<div class="line">    {</div>
<div class="line">        bar.api [async]</div>
<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>When asynchronous mode is enabled for a server-side interface, the generated code changes as follows:</p><ul>
<li><code>commandRef</code> parameter is added to the beginning of all the API functions' parameter lists.</li>
<li>return value is removed from every API function.</li>
<li><code>Respond()</code> function is generated for every API function.</li>
</ul>
<p>In async mode, the server responds to the client's call to API function <code>F()</code> by calling the associated <code>FRespond()</code> function.</p>
<p>The <code>Respond</code> functions all take the <code>commandRef</code> as their first parameter. If an API function has a return value, that return value is sent to the client through the second parameter of the <code>Respond</code> function. Any output parameters defined in the API function are also passed as parameters to the <code>Respond</code> function.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="defFilesCdef_requires"></a>
Requires</h1>
<p>The <code>requires:</code> section specifies things the component needs from its runtime environment.</p>
<p>It can contain various subsections.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="defFilesCdef_requiresApi"></a>
API</h2>
<p>Lists IPC APIs used by this component.</p>
<p>Here's a code sample of a component using the Configuration Data API (defined in le_cfg.api) to read its configuration data:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">requires:</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    api:</div>
<div class="line">    {</div>
<div class="line">        le_cfg.api</div>
<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>This creates a client-side IPC interface called <code>le_cfg</code> on this component, and it makes the functions and data types defined inside <code>le_cfg.api</code> available for use in the component's program code.</p>
<p>The name of the <code></code>.api file (minus the <code></code>.api extension) is the name of the interface, and in C code, the names of functions and data types defined in the <code></code>.api file are prefixed with the name of the interface with an underscore separator.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">requires:</div>
<div class="line">{</div>

<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>To rename the interface, an interface name followed by an equals sign ('=') can be added in front of the <code></code>.api file path.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">requires:</div>
<div class="line">{</div>
<div class="line">    api:</div>
<div class="line">    {</div>
<div class="line">        hello = greet.api <span class="comment">// Send() from the API will appear as "hello_Send()" in my code.</span></div>
<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>Multiple instances of the same API listed in the <code>api:</code> section must have unique instance names, and appear as separate functions with different prefixes.</p>

<div class="line">    }</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>If <code> digitalOutput.api </code> defines two functions <code>On()</code> <code>and</code> Off(), the component’s source code would have four functions available to it: <code>heat_On()</code>, <code>heat_Off()</code>, <code>cool_On()</code>, and <code>cool_Off()</code>.</p>
<p>C/C++ source code must <code> #include “interfaces.h”</code> to use the auto-generated function definitions. The build tools will automatically generate a version of <code>interfaces.h</code> customized for your component that includes all declarations for all the interfaces the component uses.</p>
<p>The build tools search for the interface definition (.api) file based on the interface search path.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="defFilesCdef_requiresApiOptions"></a>
Options</h3>
<p>To reduce the amount of initialization code a component needs to write, the build tools automatically generate the client-side IPC code for that API, and automatically try to connect to the server when the executable is run. There are a couple of options that can be used to suppress this behaviour.</p>
<p>The <b><code></code>[types-only</b>] option tells the build tools the client only wants to use type definitions from the API. This means the client-side IPC code will not be generated for this API, but the types defined in the API will still be available to the component (through <code>interfaces.h</code> in C/C++).</p>
<p>The <b><code></code>[manual-start</b>] option tells the build tools not to automatically connect to this API's server when the process starts. This means the component can control when it wants to connect to the server by calling the <code>xxxx_ConnectService()</code> function explicitly in the component source code.</p>

<p>Also, on the target device at runtime, the dynamic linker will look for the library so it must be made available inside the app sandbox, somewhere in the dynamic linker's library search path. This can be done using the <code>files:</code> or <code>dirs:</code> subsection of the <code>requires:</code> section of either the <code>.cdef</code> or <code>.adef</code> file.</p>

<p>Specifying a dependency on another component ensures that calls to component initialization functions ( <code>COMPONENT_INIT</code> in C/C++ components ) are sorted in the correct order. If component A depends on component B, then component B will be initialized first.</p>
<p>Dependency loops are not allowed: component C can't depend on another component that (either directly or indirectly) depends on component C. The build tools detect dependency loops and report any error.</p>
