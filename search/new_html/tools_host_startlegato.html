<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><code>startlegato [LOG_FILE]</code><br />
</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>startlegato launches the Legato Service Directory, Log Control Daemon and Config Tree on the localhost machine. This provides a legato environmnet in which you can run and test apps on the localhost that have been built for the localhost target.</p>
<p>If given, LOG_FILE specifies the name of a file to output the legato log messages to.</p>
<p>Exit code:</p><ul>
<li>0 if the services started successfully</li>
<li>1 if the services were already running</li>
<li>2 if an error occurred</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently running supervisor on localhost is not supported so apps requiring the services of the supervisor or the associated watchdog service cannot be run on localhost at this time.</p>
