<p><b>setname</b> - change the hostname of the target</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><code>setname NAME [TARGET_IP]</code><br />
</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>With a default prompt set, when you log into the target by UART or ssh, the commandline prompt will be root@swi-mdm9x15. If you are logged into multiple targets or you have multiple targets on your network, it can be helpful to give each its own hostname so its easy to tell which device you have connected to. After running this command, the hostname of the target will be changed to the name given in NAME.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<pre class="fragment">If the TARGET_IP value is not given and the environment variable DEST_IP
is set then DEST_IP will be used as TARGET_IP
</pre><h1>NOTES</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the way shells set up their internal variables only the prompt of new shells will manifest the new hostname. Currently open shells will continue to show the previous hostname.</p>
