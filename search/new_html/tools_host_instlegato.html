<p><b>instlegato</b> - install legato on target</p>
<h1>SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><code>instlegato BUILD_DIR [TARGET_IP]</code><br />
</p>
<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Once Legato has been built, instlegato can be used to install it on the target at the IP address specified by TARGET_IP. BUILD_DIR is the path to the directory to which Legato was built. If the target Legato directory is in the normal build location, i.e. Inside $LEGATO_ROOT/build, then you only need to specify the target platform, e.g. ar7, otherwise a full path is required.</p>
<h1>ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<pre class="fragment">If the TARGET_IP value is not given and the environment variable DEST_IP
is set then DEST_IP will be used as TARGET_IP
