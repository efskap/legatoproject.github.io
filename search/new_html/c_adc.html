<hr />
<p>This API provides definitions for reading ADC inputs.</p>
<p>le_adc_ReadValue returns the value read from an ADC channel. It takes two arguments: The first is the number of the ADC channel to read. The second is used to return the value read.</p>
<p>The ADC channels are multiplexed to a single Ananlog to Digital Converter. A call to le_adc_ReadValue will cause the associated channel to be connected to the input of the ADC, trigger a conversion and return the value read.</p>
<p>At this time it is not possible to change the scaling factor, sample time or reference voltage. Channels EXT_ADC1 and EXT_ADC2 are externally available for general use and by default use 1.8V reference and return results in mV.</p>
