<div class="textblock"><p>You need to <a class="el" href="getstarted_config_i_p.html">Configure IP Address</a> before you can install Legato on a target.</p>
<p>We use a serial communication program like Minicom to access the target through the UART port to for console communications. Ethernet and Micro-USB ports are used for development. See <a class="el" href="getstarted_dev_kit_cables.html">Dev Kit Cables</a> for more info.</p>
<p>If you're using Minicom, you access the config and initialize menus through <code>CTRL+A</code> Z.</p>
<p>Run as <b>root</b> user, so no password is required.</p>
<p>Once the host and target are communicating, you can complete the target setup.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Use the <a class="el" href="tools_target_set_net.html">setNet</a> tool to set your MAC address so you don't have to go through <code>ifconfig</code> every time you reboot the target.</dd></dl>
