<div class="textblock"><p>Use the Set MAC Address tool to set your MAC address and optionally a static IP address.</p>
<p>The dev kit board Ethernet port doesn't have a permanent MAC address. Each time the target starts, a locally administered MAC address is generated. With DHCP, this will likely also cause your IP address to change. With a static IP address, the IP address won't change, but switching equipment may result in errors because the IP address is being used by a new target.</p>
<p>If you're confident editing the <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> file (e.g., created some up/down rules for <code>eth0</code>), then you probably don't want to use <code>setNet</code> (it won't merge well). You can restore your <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> file after running <code>setNet:</code> <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> is renamed with a date and time suffix.</p>
<h1>Usage</h1>
<p><b><code> setNet [macrandom|macfixed] [dhcp|static] [address <address>] [netmask <netmask>] </code></b></p>
<p>Use <code>macfixed</code> to set the dev board to use the MAC provided at boot time, and continue to use DHCP for the IP address.</p>
<p>Use <code>static</code> to set a fixed MAC regardless of whether <code>macrandom</code> is provided (<code>setNet</code> <code>static</code> is equivalent to <code>setNet</code> <code>macfixed</code> <code>static</code>).</p>
<p>If logged in over <code>ssh</code>, close the session quickly as ssh tends to hang. Then run ssh like this: </p><pre class="fragment">ssh root@<ip address> 'setNet <commands>'
</pre><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd><code>setNet</code> only supports IPv4 addresses at the moment. No address, gateway or netmask values validation is done.</dd></dl>
<p>To display usage, run </p><pre class="fragment">setNet --help </pre><hr />
